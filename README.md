# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Inside-Airbnb-Zurich-data



The data used in the present study come from InsideAirbnb.com (n.d.). According to the site operators, ‘Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world’. The data sets are actually a time snapshot and contain publicly available information about the lodgings, the host, customer reviews etc. We chose the city of Thessaloniki and downloaded the file listings.csv.gz, as it contains the most detailed information. The file was compiled on March 11th 2019 and the data refer to that time period.
